## Bruteforcing to derive π

![image](mc%20demo.gif)


### How?

- Creating a canvas - with a square, and a circle that fully fills the square
- Plotting a point with randomly generated co-ordinates.
- Measuring (through the pythagoras theorem) if the point falls within the circle or not.
- Getting the ratio of points in the circle, to those generated in total
- Multiplying the ratio by 4 - to get π
